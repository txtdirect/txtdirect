# Support using TXTdirect

Welcome to TXTdirect! We use Github for tracking bugs and feature requests.


There are helpful volunteers who may be able to help you.
If your particular issue turns out to be a bug, it will find its way from there.

If it happens that you know the solution to an existing bug, please first open the issue in order to keep track of it.
Afterwards open the relevant pull/merge request that potentially fixes it.

Please remember this is a community project and you are not entitled to free support.
Be kind to anyone helping out.
